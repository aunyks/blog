        Since the recent meteoric rise in popularity of <Hint msg="NFT stands for Non-Fungible token: a token that's not identical to the next.">NFTs</Hint>, creators and developers alike have been
        drawing attention to the variety of applications that these tokens have across industries. A popular area of mention is gaming: many claim that NFTs will be a great addition to video games
        for players and developers alike. While the widespread introduction of NFTs into gaming may seem like it's but a matter of time, there's a glaring issue hindering adoption: it's not yet worth it.

      <h3>The Status Quo</h3>
      <p>
        Large game studios like Epic, EA, and Activision have created large platforms fit with player identity, skins, achievements, accessories, and more. With this proprietary infrastrucure, these
        companies can build their own economies into their games, letting players sign in to the platform, buy in-game currencies, and use these currencies to buy virtual goods. With ownership of the platform
        and, thus, the economy in their hands, these large game studios have no reason to open their technology to others. Doing so would result in a loss of revenue, which is the ultimate deterrant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some studios like Roblox have gained popularity by letting creators and developers create their own games or accessories. But, ultimately key platform features like identity and currency are controlled
        by the company. With the company maintaining sole ownership of the platform, creators and developers remain at the mercy of the platform owner. In this model, the platform owner can always deplatform
        items and games that compete with its own. This model is a step in the right direction, but we now have tools given to us by the third generation of the web that let us create completely open game platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today's blockchain technologies give game developers an open identity and currency platform through wallets and tokens, and NFTs now give them the ability to create rare items that can exist in an infinite number of
        games. Even with these tools now available to us, we're left with the same problems as before: why should developers use these open platforms if it means less money in their pockets? Well, when operating alone, they shouldn't: the closed off economy will always be available to those
        who desire the traditional development strategy. But the new era of the decentralized web lets creators and developers realize the potential of the most open platform on the Internet. To truly capture the
        value of this new generation, there's a new organizing structure that developers need. Enter the GameDAO.
      </p>
      <h3>The Next Generation</h3>
      <p>
        A GameDAO is a decentralized, internet-first collective of game developers that coordinates the creation of gameplay items using crypto-first tools. In doing so, the GameDAO generates revenue by selling these items
        in-game or on a marketplace. Members of the DAO generate demand for the items by integrating them into their games (if relevant) and granting owners of the items certain functional or aesthetic improvements, like power-ups or skins.
        Revenue generated by the DAO will be distributed among the members to incentivize further participation. Membership in a GameDAO can be managed in any way members see fit, but it'd be best to grant membership as a reward to any developer
        who integrates the DAO's items into their games, as wider item adoption creates more demand for each item and thus revenue for the DAO.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a GameDAO grows in membership, the share of the DAO's revenue that each member earns may decrease. For this reason, members may decide to form competing GameDAOs in search of more earnings per member. As these organizations proliferate,
        we'll see competition that reminds of corporate competition we see today. It may seem like we'll come full circle in this future, but the reality is that, amidst this change, the newly formed metaverse will see a grand change toward player-centrism.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rise of GameDAOs will create a world where players keep their own identities in their wallet and on the blockchain. Any data that a game will have will be mostly ephemeral and derivative of the information that it's given by the user <em>and</em> the blockchain.
        It will create a world where most of a player's gameplay will be. All of this is because they'll be built on open platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tools to create and run a GameDAO are already here. DAO creation is easier than ever, several NFT platforms are readily available, and every major game engine now has a plugin for using Ethereum APIs. All that's left is an ambitious group
        of founders willing to bring the GameDAO into fruition. <em>When the GameDAOs reach critical mass, nobody will own the platform, because everybody will.</em>
