      <h2>A Background</h2>
      <p>
        The weekend was coming and I decided to save a bit of my free time after
        work for some creative expression. "Lemme get some practice in with
        these filters," I thought, referring to my{' '}

      <h2>An Idea</h2>
      <p>
        I didn't really have a project idea, though. I laid in my bed for
        another thirty minutes before remembering that I had to go to DC in a
        few days to finish moving out of my dorm. That reminded me of the DC
        Metro and how the system was a bit tricky for me to navigate at times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then it hit me. I'm gonna make the Metro map pop up when the Metro card
        is in view. That's a cool thing that I'd use regularly if I were new to
        the system again. I opened up{' '}
        <a target="_blank" href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio">
          Spark AR
        </a>{' '}
        and got to work on the core functionality. After adding some hints and
        animations, I tested the effect on my phone with an actual Metro card.
        My eyes lit up. I thought it was really cool! So, I quickly designed a
        logo, came up with a <span title="Smartmap Card">name</span>, and
        submitted it to Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following day I recorded a short demo video showing the effect and
        posted it to Instagram and Twitter since I thought the project was so
        cool.

      <h2>Rejection</h2>
      <p>
        I logged back out of them to get some more work done only to check
        Facebook every couple hours to check on the status of the filter
        submission. At the end of the day, it was denied with feedback saying
        that there was "Too much text". "Too much text? It's an image of a map,
        and some published filters already have maps with more text in them". I
        instantly hit the resubmit button with examples of effects with the same
        amount of or more text.
      </p>
      <p>
        The work day was coming to an end so I signed back in to Instagram and
        Twitter to see the posts getting lots of attention. A couple hundred
        likes, comments, and retweets were beyond the normalcy of my
        notifications tabs, so they certainly caught my eye. One last check on
        the resubmission status resulted in another rejection by Facebook citing
        the same issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wasn't gonna change the filter, since it did exactly what I wanted. I
        was incredibly annoyed. I wanted to let people experience the filter,
        otherwise the effect in the video was indistinguishable from something
        made in software like After Effects. I slept on it and woke up to tell
        people what happened.

      <h2>An Alternative</h2>
      <p>
        I remembered that Facebook/Instagram wasn't the only social platform
        that lets creators make AR effects, so I turned to Snapchat. I'd been a
        bit intimidated by the idea of making Snapchat filters, as I'd never
        understood how to use its{' '}
        <a target="_blank" href="https://lensstudio.snapchat.com">
          Lens Studio
        </a>{' '}
        software, and there wasn't as much easy-to-find content teaching people
        how to make stuff with it as for Facebook's Spark AR Studio. But, I was
        so focused on getting this idea in people's hands that I spent some
        hours learning how to use it so I could port my filter to Snapchat's
        platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of the day, I'd overcome my fear and learned just enough of
        the platform to get my idea going.

        I finished it. By the end of the night, I'd successfully ported Smartmap
        Card from FB/IG to Snapchat. I submitted the filter and felt needed
        excitement when I saw that it was accepted and live in minutes, much
        faster than Facebook's hours to weeks. I went to sleep knowing I was
        gonna record a new demo video to show off the better marker tracking
        that Snapchat offered in addition to a link to the filter that people
        could use whenever they wanted to use the filter.

        I posted the filter to Twitter in its new form, very satisfied that I
        got a really cool project out that people can actually use. I then
        edited the caption in my original Instagram post instructing people to
        DM me if they wanted to try the filter out on Snapchat.
      </p>
      <h2>Virality</h2>
      <p>
        About an hour passed and the tweet blew up with likes, replies, and
        retweets (with and without comment). The Instagram post was still
        garnering an unusually great amount of interest. My Instagram DMs were
        blowing up with people requesting access, so I just linked directly to
        the filter from my website and updated the Instagram caption to have
        people check the link in my bio to use the filter.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the next week, both my posts reached some six figures in impressions
        per day, and with each passing day more people were recording themselves
        being wowed while trying the filter out on their Metro cards. A couple
        of TikToks, Reddit threads, and Instagram reposts came about. At this
        point, the filter was much bigger than me. Literally so, as accounts
        were now sharing and reposting without giving credit. It's part of the
        game, though.
      </p>
      <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        In the midst of all that, I'd gained a couple hundred new followers on
        Instagram and Twitter, saw some 3,000 visits to my website, and made a
        few more filters very similar to this one. These newer filters featured
        maps for{' '}

        , and they're exclusive to Snapchat. I'd been reminded that metro
        systems also have limited edition cards and that in some systems those
        who are disabled get cards with unique designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned that Snapchat's AR platform has much better technology than
        Facebook's with respect to marker tracking, face+hand tracking,
        segmentation, and more respects. Snap's Lens Studio and publishing
        workflow also provides a much better experience than that of Facebook's
        Spark. So the only ways that Facebook's platform beats Snap's are by
        providing a more approachable programming experience to creators through
        its{' '}

        , allowing creators to program{' '}

        filters, and by having a larger user base.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the end I don't quite know what's next for these projects, if
        anything, but it was certainly interesting getting a taste of Internet
        virality.
