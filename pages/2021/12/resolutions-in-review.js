        , and 2021 is no different. The year has come to a close, and it's time
        to revisit the resolutions I made. Without further ado, let's get
        started.

      <h2>Review</h2>
      <p>
        As you can tell, my priorities drastically changed throughout the year
        in comparison to when these were made. Here are some positives.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>I graduated college!</li>
        <li>
          I started a full time job! I'm a Software Engineer at a fintech
          company
        </li>
        <li>
          I've had a consistent gym routine since May and I've gained a lot of
          good weight
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I've spent a lot of time with introspection. I've been asking myself
        what I want from myself and from the world in addition to what I can
        give back to the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I noticed that since ~July 2020 I've had online fatigue and have slowly
        been spending less time on social media. I still lurk around here on
        occasion, and if you have a blog I've been reading it. But, I spend less
        time online for my mental health nowadays.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately this has been a year of exploration. I didn't *do* as much as
        I did in past years for reasons. But, one thing I did that'll increase
        my potential to do things in the future is explore myself, my interests,
        my past, and future.
      </p>
      <h2>What can you expect from me now?</h2>
      <p>
        I plan to slowly get back online more often, so if you're on Twitter you
        may start seeing me tweet more frequently again and maybe even
        interacting with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        My love for biology (older than my relationship with computing) is
        returning, and you'll see me write about synthetic biology and adjacent
        fields a bit more. You might've seen the hint{' '}

        .
      </p>
      <p>
        More casual tweets. For a long time I almost exclusively talked about
        crypto or computers on there, and those won't be my only topics anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll start to see me contributing to open source projects on main
        again. For months I contributed to some open source projects from
        pseudonymous accounts, but I'll be doing so from my main account again
        from now on.
      </p>
      <p>
        This year was a slow recovery from a bit of a low point for me. See you
        in the new year!
