          Thanks for reading. If you're looking for further reading, be sure to read the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching">Dao De Jing</a>.
          My post on <a href="/2020/8/the-cycle-of-human-progress">The Cycle of Human Progress</a> is an example of a cycle in human society.

        Balance isn’t a static. Rather, balance is a state of perpetual motion. It’s the constant cycle between states. It’s the perpetual pull of opposing actions.

        The simplest form of balance in motion is the wave. Waves are balanced because of their continuous oscillation between just two states. Think of a dot swaying from the right to left and back again, or a sine wave moving between a maximum and minimum value.

        The most general and thus common form of balance in motion is the cycle. Cycles are balanced because of their continuous oscillation among many states. Think of a clock hand rotating throughout the day, always cycling between the 60 minutes in an hour.

        Cycles are common all throughout nature. The temperature over many years will always cycle between hot and cold. The opposite nature of warmer and cooler temperatures balances the overall state
        of the weather over the course of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even decades and centuries-long periods show cyclical balance. Periods of global warming are followed by periods of global cooling via ice ages. Knowing this, we become aware that balance is <em>always</em> achieved
        regardless of the lengths we go to bring imbalance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, balance is dynamic, always in motion. In moving, an entity constantly flows between some states. Balance takes form in cycles. It's the way of the world, and it’s a fundamental law of life and nature, so be mindful of it in all that you do.
