        About two months ago, I bought an inexpensive keyboard piano and learned to play a couple songs. It was my
        first time
        playing piano since my childhood, and I must say it's been a refreshing experience.

      <p>
        I want to learn to play more music and experiment with composing and producing my own, and I think
        understanding music theory will serve as the perfect catalyst for reaching these goals. With this being said,
        I'm going to compile the interesting stuff I learn here.

      <h3 id="whats-music-theory">What's music theory?</h3>
      <p>
        I define music theory as the exploration into why music and sound make us feel the way we do. It's the theory behind the notes, chords,
        and rhythms that make music evoke certain human emotions.

      <h3 id="why-music-theory">Why music theory?</h3>
      <p>
        Some knowledge of music theory is a prerequisite for all musicians who want to learn, play, or create music
        more quickly. I want to take my music skills to another level, and knowing music theory will help me get
        there.
        </p>
      <h3 id="get-started">Alright now where's the stuff?</h3>
      <p>
        I'll be breaking knowledge into chapters, because the knowledge area of music theory is vast and I'd hate for
        this post to be too long. With this being said, the list is as follows.
        </p>
      <p>
        NOTE: In the posts, feel free to try playing the notes wherever you see a keyboard by just hitting the keys!
        I want this
        to be an interactive experience. I'll also be writing these lessons through the lense of piano playing, so it
        might not be as easy if you're using a different type of instrument.
